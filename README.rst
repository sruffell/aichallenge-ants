AI Challenge - Ants
===================

This repository was my submission for the `AI Challenge - Ants`_ in Fall of
2011. This bot placed 476th_ out of 7900 submissions, but I was never sure how
many of those submissions were really serious.

The code here will not run unless you also install the tools_ provided on the AI
Challenge website. Anyway, here it is. This was some of the most fun I've had
programming recently.
